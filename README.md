# Road Song

A chaotic, high-contrast **Neo-Brutalist** Flutter application built to log messy trips, capture typewriter logs, gather evidence (receipts, notes, photos), and synthesize audio tracks from trip vibes.

---

## 🎨 The Neo-Brutalist Aesthetic

Road Song rejects boring, flat, modern UI designs in favor of **Neo-Brutalism**:
- **High Contrast**: Flat, vibrant colors accented by thick `#111111` borders (`BrutalTheme.inkBlack`).
- **Heavy Shadows**: Hard offset shadows (`Offset(4, 4)`) with no blur.
- **Physical Details**: Polaroid-style photo layouts, mock Dymo tape labels, and physical tape overlays.
- **Staggered Layouts**: Asymmetrical grid systems and textured background grains (`GrainOverlay`).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **📂 Messy Scrapbook**: A staggered cards list containing trip collections (e.g., Cabo, Vegas, Mudfest) with customizable tilting, tape aesthetics, and instant chaos triggers.
*   **⌨️ Typewriter Log**: A classic analog typewriter emulator to write trip journal entries.
*   **📸 Evidence Vault**: A gallery of Polaroid logs, receipt captures, and evidence folders.
*   **🎵 Vibe Studio**: An interactive audio visualizer and banger editor to synthesize sound tracks matching your trip's energy.
*   **👤 Chaotic Profile**: Manage traveler information (like Seagull fighting credits) under custom Brutalist cards.
